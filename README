This is a MIDI implementation of a MOS6581 SID chip using the reSID library. It includes support for scripted instruments that allow complex sonic control of the chip.

Dependencies:
libglib-2.0
libjack-dev
resid

resid can be downloaded and installed from http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/resid/index.html
just extract that archive and issue the commands:
   cd remid
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

Once the dependencies are fulfilled return to this folder and run:
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   
Currently this will build and install the standalone. At some point I hope it will also make a plugin version

reMID has scripting capabilities so that you can create instruments and files containing banks of instruments. You cannot actually get any sound out of reMID without an instrument file (so naturally we include and install a default). See instruments.conf for examples and more info on instrument parameters.

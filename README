This is a MIDI implementation of a MOS8580 6581 SID chip using the reSID library. It includes support for scripted instruments that allow complex sonic control of the chip.


Dependencies:
libglib-2.0
libjack-dev (standalone version)
liblv2-dev (plugin version)

Once the dependencies are fulfilled return to this folder and run:
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   
Currently this will build and install the standalone and the lv2 plugin. At some point I hope it will allow just one or just the other if you want.

reMID has scripting capabilities so that you can create instruments and files containing banks of instruments. You cannot actually get any sound out of reMID without an instrument file (so naturally we include and install a default). See instruments.conf for examples and more info on instrument parameters.
also see http://gp2x.org/remid/inst_config.php 
Eventually I'll copy that documentation here as well.

V1
fix default instrument
add opcodes for voice detune (is freq. resolution fine enough? I think so)
add env3tofilter opcode
add osc3tofilter opcode

V2 - single voice, no perc. mode :(
perhaps should add N voices in GUI that allows unison, perc, or preset mode (default)
make generic synth control template
change architecture so there is a "current" instrument
 and midi/gui just loads presets into it (then you can tweak and save)
make polyphony selectable
new GUI
add circular buffer to change instrument collection
learn AVTK/Pugl
refactor parser to avoid GTK (probably will scrap parser)
python utiil  to convert banks to lv2 states
